# ediarum.MINUTES.data-model

**WIP - work in progress (Feb 2026)**

This repository contains the definition of the ediarum.MINUTES data model as ODD. It is based on the ediarum.BASE.data-model (in terms of content). 

The repository contains:

* the ODD file "ediarum.MINUTES.odd". It contains specifications for allowed elements, attributes, and suggested attribute values. The schema was created based on the ODD file.
* the documentation file "ediarum.MINUTES.documentation.pdf". This documentation is an extensive written form of the ODD file with examples. It contains coding recommendations that can be used as a guide for your own projects.

The "dist" folder contains:
* the Relax NG file "ediarum.MINUTES.rng", which can be used to validate XML files against it
* the compiled ODD file "ediarum.MINUTES.xml", which can be used as a starting point for creating ODD files for project-specific adaptations and additions of ediarum.MINUTES.
